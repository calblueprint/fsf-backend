Some countries have regulations on the use of cryptographic libraries
like the ones embedded in TCLink. It may be unlawful to download TCLink
in these countries.

I. DESCRIPTION

  TCLink is a thin client library to allow your e-commerce servers to
connect to the TrustCommerce payment gateway easily and consistently.
The protocol (which is the same across all platforms and languages) is
well-documented in the Web Developer's Guide, so please consult it for
any questions you may have about the protocol syntax itself.


II. INSTALL

  Type "./configure && make" to configure and build TCLink.  To install
globally, become root and type "make install".

II. USAGE

  The included test program, tctest.c, shows a very basic transaction
run through the TCLink API.  A more complex example is contained in
tcexample.c.  In either case, you should edit the file and enter
your CustID and password into the defines at the top of the file.

  There are three ways to link against TCLink: a dynamically linked
library, a statically linked library, or directly compiling it in to your
application.  tctest.c uses this final method, as it is the simplest.
By default, all three libraries (.so, .a, and .o) will be built by the
makefile.


III. REQUIREMENTS

  You need OpenSSL to use TCLink.  It can be acquired from
www.openssl.org; most modern UNIX distributions come with it, or offer
it as an option package.

  If you are using an older install of AIX, SCO, Solaris, or other
systems which do not have /dev/urandom for the purpose of generated
secure random numbers, you may want to use a semi-random file (such as
your syslog) as a random number source for additional security.  Set
your the environment variable RANDFILE to point to the file you wish to
use for your random number source.  ~/.rnd is the default.

  If you wish to use TCLink with C++, you must encase the tclink.h
include in an extern "C" statement, like so:

extern "C" {
#include <tclink.h>
}


IV. PLATFORMS

  The included code has been tested on the following platforms:

o Fedora Linux 14 on x86-64
o Debian Linux 4.0 on x86-64
o Ubuntu 8.04.4 LTS on x86-64


  It should work on most modern UNIXes.  If you need assistance getting
it running on your platform, please email techsupport@trustcommerce.com.

### This is the repo for the FSF mobile backend.

`go/` is for our Go files. It houses the code to interact with CiviCRM and TrustCommerce: accepting payments and handling CAS login.  
`rails/` is for our Rails server. It houses endpoints and database schemas for the petition page and the newsfeed.  
`third_party/` contains third-party libraries that we integrate. Currently, it just contains the TCLink library in C.
